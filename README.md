# Digit-Recognizer-Web-App

The web app, deployed: https://aidigits.andreyskvortsov.xyz/
The neural network repo: https://github.com/A-Skvortsov/ANN-Handwritten-Digit-Rec

This web app was made using Next.js and can currently be accessed using the link above. It is being hosted using AWS EC2 with a Python backend route (the neural network + some SQLite for saving images) done using Flask. It is an application of the artificial neural network that I made, also linked above.
